# Adjustable-Voltage-regulator
Adjustable voltage regulator produces a DC output voltage, which can be adjusted to any other value of certain voltagerange. There are 2 capacitors that are placed between voltage in and voltage out nodes. There are 2 resistors that are placed in between Vout and ground. For this specific design we used the data sheet that was provided in the Rowan engineering inventory under power management. Using the schematics provided in the data sheet we were able to redesign the adjustable linear regulator using the Diptrace software. We used LM317LBZRAG, 2 CAP400 (0.1uF and 1 uF), 2 resistors (5k ohms and 240 ohms),GND, input, adjustable and output pin(to input voltage and output voltage to the regulator)to design the adjustable voltage regulator.
